        <h2>Question 9</h2>
        <p>You have an Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) domain. The domain contains three servers named Server1, Server2, and Server3 that run Windows Server.</p>
        <p>You sign in to Server1 by using a domain account and start a remote PowerShell session to Server2. From the remote PowerShell session, you attempt to access a resource on Server3, but access to the resource is denied.</p>
        <p>You need to ensure that your credentials are passed from Server1 to Server3. The solution must minimize administrative effort.</p>
        <p>What should you do?</p>

Configure Kerberos constrained delegation<br><br>Explanation: I will go with A, because the Questions says to minimize administrative effort.<br>The table in the linked source states that Just Enough Administration (JEA) can provide the best security but requires more detailed configuration.<br>JEA allows you to restrict what commands an administrator can run during a PowerShell session.
