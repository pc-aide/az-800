        <p>You have a server named Server1 that runs Windows Server and has the Hyper V server role installed. Server1 hosts a virtual machine named VM1.
        Server1 has an NVMe storage device. The device is currently assigned to VM1 by using Discrete Device Assignment.
        You need to make the device available to Server1.
