        <h2>Question 5</h2>
        <p>You have an Azure virtual machine named Server1 that runs a network management application. Server1 has the following network configurations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Network interface: Nic1</li>
            <li>IP address: 10.1.1.1/24</li>
            <li>Connected to: Vnet1/Subnet1</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You need to connect Server1 to an additional subnet named Vnet1/Subnet2. What should you do?</p>

        <div class="question-row">
            <label><input type="radio" name="question5" value="Modify the IP configurations of Nic1"> A. Modify the IP configurations of Nic1</label>

        </div>
        <div class="question-row">
            <label><input type="radio" name="question5" value="Create a private endpoint on Subnet2"> D. Create a private endpoint on Subnet2</label>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
            <p>First, add another network interface to Server1, then connect it to Subnet2. A subnet is a range of IP addresses in the virtual network. You can divide a virtual network into multiple subnets for organization and security. Each NIC in a VM is connected to one subnet in one virtual network. NICs connected to subnets (same or different) within a virtual network can communicate with each other without any extra configuration. A network interface (NIC) is the interconnection between a virtual machine and a virtual network. A virtual machine must have at least one NIC. A virtual machine can have more than one NIC, depending on the size of the VM you create.</p>
