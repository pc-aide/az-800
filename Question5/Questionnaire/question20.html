        <h2>Question 20</h2>
        <p>Your on-premises network has an IP address range of 10.0.0.0/23.</p>
        <p>You have an Azure virtual network named VNet1 that contains a virtual machine named VM1.</p>
        <p>VNet1 has an IP address range of 10.0.1.0/24.</p>
        <p>You need to deploy a Site-to-Site (S2S) VPN to connect the on-premises network to VNet1.</p>
        <p>What should you do first?</p>

        <button class="solutionButton" data-solution-info-id="solutionInfo20" data-correct-answer="item20.3" data-answer-name="answer20" data-solution-text="Correct answer: Configure VNet1 to use the IP address range of 10.0.2.0/24.<br><br>Explanation: Since your on-premises network has an IP address range of 10.0.0.0/23 and VNet1 currently has an IP address range of 10.0.1.0/24, which overlaps with the on-premises network, you need to change the IP address range of VNet1 to ensure that it does not overlap with the on-premises network.<br><br>There is an overlap in the ranges 10.0.0.0/23 and 10.0.1.0/24 as the 10.0.1.0/24 range is entirely contained within the 10.0.0.0/23 range.<br><br>Answer is C because of the overlapping of address.<br>On-prem has the range of 10.0.0.0 - 10.0.1.255.<br>Azure VNet1 has the range of 10.0.1.0 - 10.0.1.255.<br>Azure Extended Network can work with overlapping address ranges.">Solution</button>
