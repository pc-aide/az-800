        <p>You need to configure NIC teaming for LAN2 and LAN3. The solution must support Dynamic Virtual Machine Multi-Queue (d.VMMQ).</p>
        <p>What should you use?</p>

        <button class="solutionButton" data-solution-info-id="solutionInfo1" data-correct-answer="item1.2" data-answer-name="answer1" data-solution-text="Correct answer: Switch Embedded Teaming (SET).<br><br>Explanation: Based on the information provided, you should use B. Switch Embedded Teaming (SET). SET is a feature available in Windows Server 2016 and later versions, including Windows Server 2022. It allows you to group between one and eight physical Ethernet network adapters into one or more software-based virtual network adapters. These virtual network adapters provide the same level of functionality as any other physical network adapter in a system.<br><br>Moreover, SET supports various features such as RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access), which is supported by LAN2 and LAN3 according to the table, and Dynamic Virtual Machine Multi-Queue (d.VMMQ). Therefore, SET is the correct choice for configuring NIC teaming for LAN2 and LAN3.<br><br>Please note that while configuring SET, ensure that all the network adapters that you want to add to a SET team are of the same speed. In this case, both LAN2 and LAN3 have a link speed of 25 Gbps, so they can be added to a SET team.<br><br>For reference: <a href='https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/1369473/switch-embedded-teaming-hyper-v-port-vs-dynamic' target='_blank'>Switch Embedded Teaming</a>.">Solution</button>
