        <h2>Question 19</h2>
        <p>Your company has a main office and a branch office. The two offices are connected by using a WAN link. Each office contains a firewall that filters WAN traffic.</p>
        <p>The network in the branch office contains 10 servers that run Windows Server. All servers are administered from the main office only.</p>
        <p>You plan to manage the servers in the branch office by using a Windows Admin Center gateway.</p>
        <p>On a server in the branch office, you install the Windows Admin Center gateway by using the defaults settings.</p>
        <p>You need to configure the firewall in the branch office to allow the required inbound connection to the Windows Admin Center gateway.</p>
        <p>Which inbound TCP port should you allow?</p>

Port 443 is used for HTTPS connections, which encrypts the communication between the client and the gateway. Port 6516 is used for the Windows Remote Management (WinRM) protocol, which is a standard Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP)-based, firewall-friendly protocol that allows you to remotely manage Windows-based servers and clients.<br>For reference: <a href='https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/manage/windows-admin-center/azure/deploy-wac-in-azure' target='_blank'>Deploy WAC in Azure</a>">Solution</button>
