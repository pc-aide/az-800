        <h2>Question 13</h2>
        <p>You have an on-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) domain that syncs with an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant. The domain contains two servers named Server1 and Server2.</p>
        <p>A user named Admin1 is a member of the local Administrators group on Server1 and Server2.</p>
        <p>You plan to manage Server1 and Server2 by using Azure Arc. Azure Arc objects will be added to a resource group named RG1.</p>
        <p>You need to ensure that Admin1 can configure Server1 and Server2 to be managed by using Azure Arc.</p>
        <p>What should you do first?</p>

        <button class="solutionButton" data-answer-name="answer13" data-correct-answer="A" data-solution-info-id="solutionInfo13" data-solution-text="Correct answer: A. From the Azure portal, generate a new onboarding script.<br><br>Explanation: The question asks that 'Admin1', a user account, has the appropriate permissions. The role of Azure Connected Machine Onboarding can only be assigned to a service principal, as confirmed by the link given to justify the wrong answer. Admin1 cannot be assigned this role, it's impossible, check it for yourself. Admin1, as a local server admin, has all the rights he/she needs. The correct answer is 'A', generate a new onboarding script. One can onboard more than one server with the same script. Onboarding two certainly doesn't impose an administrative burden to use this method.<br>For reference: <a href='https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-arc/servers/onboard-portal' target='_blank'>Azure Arc Onboarding</a>">Solution</button>
