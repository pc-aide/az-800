<div id="solutionInfo_question1" class="solutionInfo" style="display: none;">
  <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
  <p>File1 is deduplicated after the deduplication job runs: Yes, because File1 is moved to volume D which has deduplication enabled.</p>
  <p>File3 is deduplicated after the deduplication job runs: No, because File3 is moved to volume E, where deduplication is not mentioned.</p>
  <p>File4 is deduplicated after the deduplication job runs: Yes, because File4 is a copy of File2 and will be on volume D with deduplication enabled.</p>
