        <h2>Question 8</h2>
        <p>Your company has offices in Boston and Montreal. The offices are connected by using a 10-Mbps WAN link that is often saturated.
        The office in Boston contains the following:
        <ul>
            <li>An Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) domain controller named DC1</li>
            <li>A server named Server1 that runs Windows Server and has the File Server role installed</li>
        </ul>
        The office in Montreal contains 20 client computers that run Windows 10. Montreal does NOT have any servers.
        The company plans to deploy a new line-of-business (LOB) application to all the client computers. The installation source files for the application are in \\Server1\Apps.
        You need to make the installation source files available to the client computers in the Montreal office by using the minimum amount of WAN bandwidth possible.
        What should you do?</p>
