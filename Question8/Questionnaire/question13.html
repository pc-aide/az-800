        <h2>Question 13</h2>
        <p>You have an on-premises DNS server named Server1 that runs Windows Server. Server1 hosts a DNS zone named fabnkam.com.
        You have an Azure subscription that contains the resources shown in the following table.</p>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Name</th>
                <th>Type</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>vnet1</td>
                <td>Virtual network</td>
                <td>Connects to the on-premises network by using a Site-to-Site VPN</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>VM1</td>
                <td>Virtual machine</td>
                <td>Runs Windows Server & has the DNS Server role installed</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>contoso.com (private)</td>
                <td>Private DNS zone</td>
                <td>Linked to vnet1</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>contoso.com (public)</td>
                <td>Public DNS zone</td>
                <td>Contains the DNS records of all the platform as a service (PaaS) resource</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>You need to design a solution that will automatically resolve the names of any PaaS resources for which you configure private endpoints in Vnet1.
        How should you configure the name resolution? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.</p>
