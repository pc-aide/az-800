        <h2>Question 9</h2>
        <p>You have an on-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) domain that syncs with an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant. Group writeback is enabled in Azure AD Connect.
        The AD DS domain contains a server named Server1. Server1 contains a shared folder named share1.
        You have an Azure Storage account named storage2 that uses Azure AD-based access control. The storage2 account contains a share named share2.
        You need to create a security group that meets the following requirements:
        <ul>
            <li>Can contain users from the AD DS domain</li>
            <li>Can be used to authorize user access to share1 and share2</li>
        </ul>
        What should you do?</p>
